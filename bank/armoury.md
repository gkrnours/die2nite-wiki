Armoury
-------
The Armoury stores Weapons, which are used to kill zombies without using Small
pa.gif. Note that weapons which can break CANNOT be used while Status tired.gif
Exhausted (so you must have Small pa.gif to use them), but will not consume any
Small pa.gif on use.
All Reloadable weapons that store multiple shots use up one shot of their
ammunition per use; if you use an Item watergun opt 5.gif Aqua-Splash (5 shots)
three times in a zone with three zombies, you will have an Item watergun opt
2.gif Aqua-Splash (2 shots) and no zombies.
Melee weapons, rather than using up ammunition, can become Small broken.gif
Broken..., which is then denoted by a red dashed border around the item's icon.
Items with the Broken flag can be repaired with 1 Small pa.gif and either a
Item repair one.gif Kwik-Fix or a Item repair kit.gif Repair Kit.

* Don't confuse this state with items that have "Broken" in their name, like the
Item saw tool part.gif Broken Hacksaw -- as with incomplete items, the hacksaw
must be combined with other resources to become useful; the kits above will
have no effect on them.
* On the other hand, a Item bone.gif Broken Human Bone which becomes Broken in
combat (gaining the Broken flag) is called the "Broken Human Bone (broken)",
and can be repaired to have the Broken flag removed. Confused yet?
