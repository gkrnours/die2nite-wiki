After they have been placed in the bank, they can be transformed in the
workshop into basic construction materials.

Basic Construction
------------------
These items are used in most buildings. They can seem scarce prior to the
construction of a Workshop. Once a community obtaines a Workshop, however,
these resources become easily available through the conversion of low quality
resources. These basic materials are also processed into advanced construction
materials.
